<h2 align="center">Code Summary:</h2>

<p align="center">
  This Snake game uses the turtle module in Python. It sets up a game window, creates a snake and food objects, and allows the player to control the snake using arrow keys. The objective is to eat the food to grow longer and increase the score. The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with its own tail.
